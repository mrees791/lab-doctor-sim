<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a multi-threaded Java program which simulates doctors in a hospital treating patients. It was made for my CPSC-230 Systems Programming course with the goal of implementing parallel programming using shared resources.

### Built With

* [Java SE Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
* [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Install the Java SE Development Kit and Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mrees791/lab-doctor-sim.git
    ```
2. In Eclipse, select file, import, then select Existing Projects into Workspace.
3. In the Import Projects wizard, click Browse... next to the Select root directory option.
4. Select the lab-doctor-sim folder then click Finish.
5. Run the project in Eclipse.

After starting the program, you will need to select a patient file. A patient file is a text file with the patient data needed for the simulation. There are multiple example patient files located in the bin directory.
